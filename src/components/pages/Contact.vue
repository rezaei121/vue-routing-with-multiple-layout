      <div class="text">
        <p>- The Contact Us page is one of the most visited pages on any website.</p>
        <p>- That seems like a compelling enough reason to redesign your Contacts section to better meet your usersâ€™ needs and grab their attention.</p>
        <p>- While working on this post, I came across hundreds of beautifully made websites, yet their Contact Us pages were, for the most part, disappointing.</p>
        <p>- Most Contact pages are made for show, with just an email address, phone, location, and some short boring text on a plain background.</p>
